I am an ecosystem ecologist with interests in trait-based modelling, biomonitoring, ecosystem structure and function, food web construction, network analysis, remote sensing and global data analysis. I look to apply broad-scale analyses to understand how natural and anthropogenic processes influence ecosystems. My recent research focuses on using ecosystem-scale techniques to better understand the effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals in freshwater ecosystems. Currently I am working as part of a Royal Society Global Challenges grant “Developing network ecology to understand and secure resilient food systems”. Among other roles I am an early career committee member of the European Federation of Freshwater Science.

Personal bio
======

I work on ecological networks in freshwater and terrestrial ecosystems. I have moved between the different ecosystems over my career thus far, but I have always looked to investigate biological communities and species interactions to understand ecosystems.

Below is a brief summary of my research to date!

Using networks to understand ecosystems
-----
My more recent work has looked to investigate wider ecological networks (e.g., trophic and non-trophic) across terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems. This ranges from investigating multilayer networks in agricultural systems through to mapping the global patterns of different networks (i.e., the figure below showing patterns in the connectance of plant-herbivore networks).

I mainly develop analyses and tools to understand how the structure of networks translates into certain functions, and in turn how this affects the provision of ecosystem services.

Pollutant transfer and effects in river food webs
-----
For my PhD research I worked on river food webs across South Wales, investigating whether the structure of aquatic trophic interactions was important in influencing both the transfer and effects of persistent pollutants. In a series of papers we showed that food webs differentially transferred pollutants through them. We also showed that persistent pollutants (e.g., PCBs, PBDEs and organochlorines), alongside other types of urban pollution, are responsible for hindering the full recovery of urban river ecosystems from past gross organic pollution.

I've also been working on plastic pollution, specifically on how it interacts with organisms (mainly talking about ingestion and transfer through food webs). Our work has shown that by better understanding the interactions between organisms and plastic pollution we can accurately identify the environmental risks. For example we modelled the transfer of plastics through dippers (<i>Cinclus cinclus</i>) using the equation below. Where <i>dMB/dt</i> is the net flux of plastics being ingested or voided at a point in time <i>t</i> (day), <i>AE</i> is the assimilation efficiency of ingested prey (0.73), <i>Mi</i> is the mass of prey item <i>i</i> ingested at each time point (g/day), <i>CDi</i> is the concentration of plastic per unit mass of prey item <i>i</i> (particles/g dw), <i>KD</i> is the physical degradation of plastics within the dipper's gut and <i>KE</i> is the voiding rate through excretion (particles/g dw; see Table 1 for input data).

We have also been working to adjust global risk assessments of plastic pollution based on how it interacts with animals. This was the start of my global-scale research. Since then I have also made use of global water chemistry data to understand how the environmental conditions present in freshwater ecosystems may influence the toxity of pollutants.

High latitude and altitude stream systems
-----

My research career started with work in Denali National Park in Alaska (USA), investigating the composition of macroinvertebrate communities in groundwater fed streams that emerged from ancient river terraces in glaciated catchments.

I am still very much interested in high altitude and high latitude river systems, and more recently I have been involved in work on streams in the Japanese Alps. These systems seem pretty unique in comparison to other alpine stream systems that have been studied previously. They are very variable, both hydrologically and ecologically, and it might be the unique environmental conditions that promote the high levels of endemism we see in these streams. But, we don't know!
