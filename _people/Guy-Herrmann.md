I am a PhD Candidate at the University of Cardiff developing methods to automatically detect ecological interactions from video footage. With a background in Electronic Engineering (Bachelors) and Conservation and Land Management (Masters), my research looks to bridge these fields and explore technical solutions to ecological problems. I aspire to design new methods that contribute towards data driven, predictive approaches within ecology.

Outside of my work I am often playing guitar in a park or exploring the countryside around Cardiff!
