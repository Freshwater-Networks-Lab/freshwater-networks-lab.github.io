![Kyle Smith](kas.JPG){:width="300px" height="200px"}

I'm a PhD student working to support the conservation of Pickersgill's Reed Frog, an endangered frog species found exclusively in South Africa, through an integrated approach that combines the fields of community and molecular ecology. I love all things wildlife and worked for WWF prior to starting my PhD (not the wrestling organisation of course!).

Outside of my research I am most likely to be found with either a camera or a games controller in my hand. I like to try and combine science and photography to make our research more accessible (and more engaging!) to a wider audience.
