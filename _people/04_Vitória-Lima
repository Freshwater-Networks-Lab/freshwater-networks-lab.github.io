My research interests are centered on understanding ecological interactions in freshwater environments of the Brazilian semiarid (Caatinga domain), using the fish community and its parasites and prey. At Cardiff University, the study plan "Antagonistic interactions networks from intermittent rivers in the Brazilian semiarid" is being conducted through the CAPES doctoral sandwich scholarship. Our aims are to verify if human impacts, as inter-basins transpositions, are affecting the aquatic biota and its interactions.

As a PhD candidate, my research project is hosted by the Biological Sciences Program, at the Federal University of Paraíba (UFPB/Brazil), and supported by the Foundation for Support of Research in the State of Paraíba. My main work groups now are the Hidrology, Microbiology and Parasitology Lab (UFPB/Brazil), under supervision of Dr. Ana Carolina Figueiredo, and the Freshwater Network Ecology Lab, under supervision of Dr. Fredric Windsor (Cardiff University). And, last but not least, I enjoy getting to know people and places, always looking for a trail or hiking in natural landscapes, and taking Brazilian culture in my backpack wherever I go.
