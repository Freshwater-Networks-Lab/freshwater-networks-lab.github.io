I am a first year PhD Researcher interested in freshwaters and the impacts of pollutants within these envionments. I have previously investigated the fate of microplastics within dippers (Cinclus cinclus) and
published some of the first evidence of food web transfer of microplastics in freshwater ecosystems. I've also worked as a terrestrial ecologist for a large-scale consultancy undertaking ecological surveys and impact assessments for nationally significant infrastructure projects. 
Outside of work I enjoy exploring the many walks in South Wales, cooking and spending too much time playing ultimate frisbee. invested I am a network and freshwater ecologist who is interested in understanding how ecological interactions affect and are affected by environmental changes. Technically, I am the Group lead of the Freshwater Networks Lab, but really it is a massive group effort! 

Whilst we know neuroactive chemicals are pervasive in the environment, a major challenge to understand is their effects beyond those on individual organisms. My PhD project is looking to address two main questions:
(1) how do neuroactive chemicals affect ecological interactions (e.g., predation and competition) and the networks they form; and (2) do changes to ecological networks result in alterations in ecosystem function? 
We'll be looking to combine both empirical and in silico approaches to generate some of the first policy-relevant data and knowledge on the effects and risks of neuroactive chemicals on freshwater ecosystems.
