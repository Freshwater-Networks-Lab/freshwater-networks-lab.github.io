My name is Sophie Edwards, and I am a final year Integrated Masters student at Cardiff University. The aim of my Master’s project is to quantify competition in freshwater macroinvertebrate communities using stable isotope analysis. In my spare time I am an avid record collector and run Cardiff University’s Vinyl and Music Appreciation Society, in addition to being an enthusiastic crocheter.
